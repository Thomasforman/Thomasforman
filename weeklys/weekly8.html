<h3>How is the work of Pierre Huyghe relational/systemic?

</h3>
<p>
  A Lot of his work have relationships of people, technology, organisms, and environmental factors that all depend on each other. Despite Huyghe not being interested in how his work has relationships in it, it is impossible to deny that are aspects dependent on each other. My favorite work of his is “After A Life Ahead”. This large piece was done in an abandon ice skating rink and it was filled with plants and cells that have a relationship with the outside environment. Light is allowed in twice a day and a large amount of data is collected on the cells and plants. Depending on how the data changes, technological aspects of the exhibit will also change. There is also an ai app that comes along with the exhibit. It adds an invisible side of the piece only available to the viewer. This relationship between seeing the art and being a viewer is exhibited a lot in his work. This is also seen in another piece titled, “Exomind” where a live bee hive rests on top of a concrete body. This relationship is between living and the fake living to create a very meaningful art experience.
