    <h1>My Weekly for Week 3</h1>

    <h2>How is Owen's work different from other work that came before it?
</h2>
<p>Owens work seems that is combines other mediums in a very definable way. She is one of the first artists to use digital design, computer distortion, and physical painting to create image on canvas that seems like it was created in photoshop. The work is so clean in some instances that I’m surprised it was not done in Illustrator, a vector based program. Other than the mediums she uses, the actual materials is not something done by a self-proclaimed painter before. Especially in the Alphabet piece she introduces stuff like fabric onto paintings. I was impressed by how well it was integrated into the piece. She even uses bike tires on her pieces. That one was my favorite in the gallery. Everything seems so necessary to her pieces; In some instances pure paint cannot describe what she is trying to convey, so other materials are needed.</p>

<h2>How is Owen's work related to the internet?</h2>
<p>At first it was hard for me to think about how her work relates to the internet. I slept on it for a couple days and I think I have a deeper understanding of some of her pieces. Some of her work has to do a lot with layering. There is one piece that is has a boy and a dog and part of it is partially under the same print. Their two versions of the same image, layered over each other. I think this shows how many layers there are to the internet. Their is also some type of digital distortion to the piece; I think this can be a comment on how there is distortion to physical images whether that be a historical photo or someone's persona, when it appears on the internet. There is another piece made up of many paintings a little farther apart from each other and they all come together from a certain perspective to make a story. This piece also has to do with the layers of the internet. A home page is the first layer to a website, then there are layers under that can take you to a “contact me” page or a page that has a specific item for sale. Much like her work shows layers, the internet and websites are diagrams of layers.
