  <h1>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</h1>
<p>Ayn Rand believed in the importance of individual choice and happiness. She believed ones happiness came from doing stuff for themselves, not for others. She was strongly against altruism. I think these views have died out sort of, but I think everyone has a little bit of them. At heart, most of the time we are doing stuff because it makes us happy. This is also applicable to politics and special interest groups. Individuals in places of power are only looking out for themselves. They do not care about the people they can hurt through the policies implemented.</p>

<h2>What is california Idealogy</h2>
<p>California Ideology at its simplest form is this belief that encompesess this idea of importance of individual choice and selfishness with a utopian view about how everyone on the internet is equal. This belief was taken up by tech moguls in Silicon Valley during the 90s when internet technology was forming. These men were highly inspired by the writing of Ayn Rand whoâ€™s belief was centered around self-choice. They took this as inspiration to basically do whatever they wanted. In the time of the 90s any technology thought of was becoming possible and these men acted on that. These advances in technology were being combined with other theory of a world where people are connected to each other and a social hierarchy doesn't exist. This theory centered around the internet. Because successful businessmen in California had these thoughts, it became known as the Californian ideology.
