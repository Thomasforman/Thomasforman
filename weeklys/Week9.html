<h3>Can thought go on without a body?


</h3>

  Lyotard is very optimistic about the end of humanity. He believes that when humans and all life ends on earth, so will thought, that is unless we can sustain consciousness. He believes that we will fully be able to achieve that through Artificial Intelligence… although I think we can get close, I disagree that it will be possible to create the complexity of randomness and association in something nonhuman. How do you control certain levels of memory retrieval? That part of our memory is something completely random. Even if you created an Ai system that is random, there is no way to replicate truly what is “random in our head”. Everything we think about comes from associations between things we have learned overtime. I think the only way Ai could truly have thought is if it could learn and selectively choose what to pay attention to like humans, not what it thinks it should be paying attention to. I think that is the most important part of human thought… it doesnt need to focused or specific, sometimes are thoughts wander or are dumb, and I think that's a beautiful part of human consciousness.
