<h3>What are the parallels between foucault view and Cybernetics?
</h3>
<p>
  Cybernetics tries to understand and regulate every mechanism in life. It tries to make everything the same so equations and non human thought can be applied to things in humanity. This is similar to foucault who believed people regulate themselves through conforming and everyone essentially becomes the same. If everyone becomes the same, they therefore have predictable behavior. In this case, cybernetics can be used to regulate and predict human behavior if we conform like foucault believes we do.

<h3>How does the Panopticon play out in our contemporary lives?
</h3>
<p>The panopticon was translated from a term to describe prisons to be more all encompassing of how people regulate themselves in society. Through relationships of looking, only expanded by the internet, everyone is being watched. Not at all times, but the feelings of judgement we see expressed about ourselves or others has lead us believe that we are always being watched. When we believe we are being watched by others we regulate our actions through what we wear, what we say, what we eat, what things to hold as important, and so on and so on. The way humans look at each other and the regulation that comes from this looking has been an action used by man since the dawn of humans. In Contemporary times though, through new surveillance technologies, we monitor ourselves to greater lengths as privacy has become virtually extinct. People can be in our room while 5000 miles away. Government officials weâ€™ve never met can be listening to our conversations. A drone can be tracking us at all times of day. With these new technologies has emerged a greater emphasis on regulating ourselves out of the belief that we are living our lives in a panopticon 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
