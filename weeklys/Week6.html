<h3>Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?

Is cybernetics a useful tool for describing reality?</h3>
<p>
  For the purpose of how closely related these questions are I plan to answer both right here. Cybernetics is essentially the practice of analyzing every system both of man and machine. They are systems that regulate anything from our body to mathematical equations. They are constantly analyzing and making sure that systems are working consistently, but when things change, they accommodate their behavior. In this way us humans work exactly like this. Our body regulates itself and adapts when a problem occurs. Our minds even does this when we are met with some type of social barrier. In these regards I think that cybernetics show signs of a mechanical human life. But I think the one thing why cybernetics can never be a true reflection of humanity is due to personal choice, perception, and environment. Consciousness is something that cannot be analyzed by data. There is no point in studying this or else we would be rewinding back to the ideas of dualism and structuralism where psychologists analyzed individual reactions to behavior. This introspection, although key, cannot categorize a larger group, and therefore does not reflect humanity as a whole. Everyone has had their own experiences and perceives things in a different way. It would be impossible for machine to do this as it has never had real experiences that make it feel something. Even though it is an interesting question, humans could ever be categorized into one group.
