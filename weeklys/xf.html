<h3>Xenofeminism Response

  I felt very enlightened by this topic. I feel very strongly about making an internet and technology and inclusive space specifically. There are a lot of issues with the internet and technology that only convenience certain groups. Often these technologies were designed to best fit whites, specifically men. This technology spans past the internet, to even early technologies like cars who favor able-bodied. There is also bias in code. Coders aren't necessarily unbiased, they can code to make UX different based on how you identify. These are issues that we need think more about and address as not many people think about this as we move forward.

Other than the content of the reading, I found the website very interesting and inclusive. It's very easy to use and essentially you only need the 4 arrow buttons on your keyboard to operate and read through the site. It also has many languages posted to make it more open to everyone. I think it's important that these are issues are translated so more than that just English speaking persons can read this. The site is also designed very beautifully. I like the color schemes and the rather original idea. Iâ€™ve never seen a website where you click through to read a work like this. I think breaking up the site makes it less overwhelming for the reader which is a smart move.
