<h3>How do you understand the individual? Does this affect your relationship to yourself?
</h3>
<p>
  This text was really confusing for me to understand, but I think I was able to understand at least a couple points. I think the part of being an individual how you always belong to a broader category is interesting. You might think of yourself as an individual but really how do you define yourself as someone separate when it comes to describing your identity? Of course our emotions are a stream of consciousness so we are all very different from each other at any one time, but thinking more broadly about who you areâ€¦ how are we any different? For me I usually say my individualness comes from being a photographer, identifying as jewish, or living in LA, but these things are common groups a lot of people are part of. In fact I even know others who fit into all three of these categories just like me.
