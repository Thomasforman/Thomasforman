<h3>How is materiality manifested in poor images?</h3>
<p>
  As Steyerl puts it, “an image is always in motion”. She is not arguing that the images themselves are bad but the speed and physical quality of the image have an inverse relationship. As the speed of the image increases the the quality of that image decreases. The pros of the image is that it can be shared and access a million times across all issues relating to it. But the main con is how through travel, the quality of an image is devalued. The sharing of images has allowed for their material use. Through the use of the internet the way images have been reproduced and shared millions of times, is inherently a material affect. Through mass reproduction ad sharing of images, much like the real world, quality of a same product is worth more. An expensive bag made with a brand name can serve the same purpose as a ten dollar bag, but since the quality is better its worth more. The same thing occurs on the internet. People pay more for high res images as they are seen as more valuable. I have to say I definitely fall into this category as I care way too much about digital media quality. On my website I’d pay for the highest quality uploading services, I’d order my scans in large resolution, and I filled my SD card with raw images. I think from a young age I’ve always assumed physical quality of a digital image translates to how good it was considered. It could have been the best photo, but I never would of shared it if the quality was low. This article really made me think about how much of an importance I put on silly things like this.
