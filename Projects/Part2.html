    <h1>Project 1 Part 2</h1>
    <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
    <p>The goal of my website is to create a site that really shows off my work in a very professional and impressive manner. I think my outline for the website is a little ambitious, but I also think that it could be a fully functioning website I end up using if it goes well. Because of this ambition, I obviously have high hopes for my target audience and how it comes across to them. My audience is my future clients; I’m really hoping to create a website that is so cool and clean, that that alone books me some clients for photography and other projects. I want to convey that I am a professional who builds a site out of meaning to showcase my work, rather than just slap on an easy layout from squarespace. If I create a website that is straightforward yet visually stunning it will just my work look more stunning. The goal is to create a website that people want to be on; I’m hoping the audience will treat it like a rabbit hole where all my work is presented welle enough for them to want to spend hours on end looking through everything.
The biggest elements that need to be incorporated in order to achieve my ambitious goals are three things: A site that is simple, easy to use, and interactive. I know we don't go into interactivity that much in this class, but I want to at least be able to use things like mouse hovers that expand photos or a little logo that follows the mouse track. More importantly than this though is the simplicity both in use and aesthetics. The recursion of the site has to be perfect, going back to the page directly before it so people can stay in the one part of the site they were in. I also want to create an easy way to go home if they decide they rather check out the “people” category rather than the “interactive media” section, for instance. I also don't want to clutter the site with random visuals or even photos. Everything has to be clear and match a common theme from the text to graphics to layout to even the photos themselves.
