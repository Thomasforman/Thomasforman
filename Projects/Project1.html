    <h2>4 reference websites</h2>

    <p>The work of Ari Saal Forman is very unique. His website reflects his uniqueness with a website essentially in a website. I love interactivity and the fact that it becomes another screen within a screen is really cool.
</p>

    <p>I really like the entry to this website. When your cursor hovers over the earth it starts to animate and then large military gates open and take you into the site. I want to create something like this as an entrance to my website.

    <p>I like how the objects scroll up all while maintaining the logo at the top. It's important that I keep something like that for my website.

    <p>I like this photographers photo website because the photos are big enough for the viewer to see. The resolution is also very high. </p>
    <h3>4 things to include in my website design</h3>
    <img src="ig.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I also want to use a lot of my photos because it would most likely be a photography website as that is the most important thing about me. Here are some of the photos I would like to use.
</p>

    <p>I want to also have a playlist play so people can enjoy my website while listening to music. It would depend on how dark and punk I want to make my website, but I would most likely shuffle my soul playlists. </p>
    <img src="threed.jpg" alt="">
    <p>I want to create an interactive component to this website. Here is a 3d animated doll that you can move. I might want to incorporate something like this.
</p>
    <p>Lastly I want to create a tab where I talk about my life as a photographer as well as list some of my accomplishments. Iâ€™ll incorporate things like my age and where I go to school now.
